# Get To Know Me

*Okay I never made a real repository before, but I'm sick of ppl not always reading my rentries/pronouns.cc.*

## Chrysanthemum (Chrys or Len for short) [*Main Syshost*]

I'm an OSDD system, or just plural in general, collectively going by He/They UNLESS said otherwise.

\+ AuDHD, CPTSD (suspected borderline + narcissistic traits), and a lot of anxiety/paranoia.

## DNI Criteria

**My DNI is pretty small and based on my personal comfort since my stances can be inconsistent or neutral;**

- **Basic DNI, so basically bigots fuck off. I think that's obvious tho.**
- **Proship (specifically Darkship/Illegal ships); I take no sides in shipcourse, but I'm not comfortable with darkshippers *whatsoever.***
    - One example; if you ship **canonical** siblings/family, then definitely dni, zero tolerance (looking at that one Gensane shipper I saw, shame on you)
    - Obviously anything adult involving children and animals (not furries) too, but incest strikes a major cord with me
- Antiship; I'm recovering from that stressful mindset and would rather NOT deal with y'all.
- Syscourse in general.
- **Any Cluster B abuse believers.**
- **Anti-SelfDX (I'm SelfDX).**

Again, this list is for my own comfort. If you fit my DNI or make me uncomfortable enough, you're probably already hidden or I'm keeping my eye on you...

Fyi: My heavy emphasis on incest in my dni is because I introject a lot of siblings. We're highly disturbed by those types of ships.
