# Get To Know Me

*Okay I never made a real repository before, but I'm sick of ppl not always reading my rentries/pronouns.cc.*

## Chrysanthemum (Chrys or Len for short) [*Main Syshost*]

I'm an OSDD system, or just plural in general, collectively going by He/They UNLESS said otherwise.

\+ AuDHD, CPTSD (suspected borderline + narcissistic traits), and a lot of anxiety/paranoia.
  

Alterhuman/Otherkin + Full of a variety genders.

(Kenochoric genders are some of my favorites, tbh).

For more info or any specifics, consult my pronouns.cc page.

## DNI Criteria

**My DNI is pretty small and based on my personal comfort since my stances can be inconsistent or neutral;**

- **Basic DNI, so basically bigots fuck off. I think that's obvious tho.**
- Proship (specifically Darkship); I take no sides in shipcourse, but I'm not comfortable with darkshippers.
    - Comship is on thin ice due to the nuance in it.
- Antiship; I'm recovering from this stressful mindset and would rather NOT deal with y'all.
- Syscourse in general.
- **Any Cluster B abuse believers.**
- **Against self-dx, but that's mostly because I'm self-dx.**

Again, this list is for my own comfort. Otherwise I'm more of a "block if you make me genuinely uncomfortable" type of guy.

If you fit the proship or antiship categories, but still want to interact, IWC and avoid topics related to shipping or shipcourse around me. That's my suggestion.
